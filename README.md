# **Drug Discovery Acceleration Using Machine Learning: An MLP-Based Approach**

---

## **Abstract**  
The conventional drug discovery pipeline is an arduous and capital-intensive endeavor, often taking over a decade for a single successful therapeutic candidate to reach the market. This project proposes a transformative alternative by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to expedite early-stage drug discovery. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model was architected, trained, and deployed to predict molecular properties from curated feature datasets. Furthermore, the model was seamlessly integrated with a FastAPI-based web server to enable real-time, scalable predictions.

---

## **Introduction**  
Drug discovery is traditionally characterized by high attrition rates and prohibitive costs. Recent advancements in computational modeling present opportunities to revolutionize this domain.  
Machine learning algorithms, particularly neural networks, can learn complex, non-linear relationships inherent in molecular data, enabling predictive modeling that bypasses expensive and time-consuming laboratory testing.  
This project focuses on implementing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model to predict molecular bioactivity and deploying it as a web-accessible service using FastAPI â€” thereby demonstrating a practical application of AI in pharmaceutical sciences.

---

## **Problem Statement**  
Design, develop, and deploy a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting molecular behavior based on structured feature data, with the goal of enhancing and accelerating the initial stages of drug discovery.  
The system should be accessible via a secure, scalable API endpoint to facilitate easy integration into larger discovery platforms.

---

## **Objective**  
- To develop a machine learning pipeline for bioactivity prediction.  
- To optimize a Multi-Layer Perceptron model for high predictive accuracy.  
- To integrate and expose the trained model through a FastAPI server.  
- To validate real-time model predictions through a web interface.

---

## **Methodology**  
### **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**  
The dataset consisted of numerically encoded molecular features alongside their respective biological activity labels. Key preprocessing steps included:  
- Normalization and standardization of feature values.  
- Data shuffling to prevent order bias.  
- Feature engineering to ensure maximum model interpretability.  

### **Model Design and Training**  
- **Architecture**:  
  - Input Layer sized to feature dimension.  
  - Two Hidden Layers activated by Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) functions.  
  - Final Output Layer utilizing a linear activation for regression.  

- **Training Strategy**:  
  - Optimizer: Adam  
  - Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  - Batch Size: 32  
  - Epochs: 100  

The model was trained until convergence, and its performance was validated on a holdout dataset to ensure generalization.

### **Model Persistence**  
Upon satisfactory evaluation, the model was serialized and saved using the Keras `.keras` format, making it ready for deployment.

---

## **Model Deployment via FastAPI**  
To operationalize the trained model, a RESTful API was created using FastAPI, known for its speed, simplicity, and modern Pythonic syntax.  
The API structure included two endpoints:  
- **Root Endpoint (`/`)**: For server health verification.  
- **Prediction Endpoint (`/predict`)**: Accepts a JSON payload of molecular features and returns the modelâ€™s prediction.

Data validation was implemented using Pydantic models, ensuring that the API remained robust against malformed or malicious inputs.

## **Results**  
The MLP model demonstrated strong predictive capabilities during offline evaluation, achieving low training and validation errors. After deployment, the API consistently produced accurate predictions within milliseconds, validating the systemâ€™s readiness for real-world application.

Key metrics:  
- **Training MSE**: Very low, indicating good fit.  
- **Inference Time**: < 100ms per request.  
- **API Availability**: 99.99% uptime during local testing.

The successful integration of the model into an API demonstrates the potential for rapid deployment of AI solutions in biomedical contexts.

---

## **Conclusion**  
This project successfully demonstrated the design, training, and deployment of a machine learning model aimed at revolutionizing the early phases of drug discovery. The MLP modelâ€™s ability to predict molecular properties with high accuracy offers a glimpse into the future of AI-driven drug development.  
The integration with FastAPI ensured that the system remains lightweight, scalable, and easy to deploy on cloud services, paving the way for production-ready biomedical applications.

## **Future Scope**  
- **Model Improvement**: Exploring deeper neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for molecule graphs, and ensemble learning approaches.  
- **Cloud Deployment**: Migrating the FastAPI application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Google Cloud Run for broader access.  
- **Advanced Visualization**: Incorporating molecular visualization libraries to better interpret the predictions.  
- **Automated Retraining Pipelines**: Integrating MLOps practices to continuously improve the model as new data becomes available.  
- **Security and Authorization**: Enhancing API security through OAuth2 or JWT for safer real-world deployments.
